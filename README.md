## NOTE: Disconnect24 is no longer in service.
If you wish to reconnect your Wii to an alt-WC24, simply don't. There are no appropiate alternatives that you should use or support.

## Why not?
Because RiiConnect24's current head developer doesn't like it when a group of people decide that it's a good idea to fix faulty management, dodgy bahaviour and a broken service.
> This page will be updated with a full timeline of Disconnect24's life, where it cannot be censored, regardless of how much Larsen tries to edit the Wiki page.
